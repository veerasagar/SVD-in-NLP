# SVD-in-NLP

## Core Concept

SVD factorizes a matrix \( X \) into three components:

\[ X = U \Sigma V^T \]

- **\( U \)**: Orthogonal matrix (term-topic relationships).
- **\( \Sigma \)**: Diagonal matrix of singular values (strength of topics).
- **\( V^T \)**: Orthogonal matrix (document-topic relationships).

## Key Applications in NLP

### Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA/LSI)

**Purpose**: Capture hidden semantic relationships between terms and documents.

**Process**: Apply SVD to a term-document matrix (e.g., TF-IDF weighted). Truncate to \( k \) singular values to obtain a low-rank approximation.

**Benefits**:

- Reduces dimensionality, addressing sparsity and noise.
- Mitigates synonymy (different words with similar meanings) and polysemy (same word with multiple meanings) by grouping related terms/documents in latent space.
- Enhances tasks like document clustering, classification, and retrieval.

### Word Embeddings

**Co-occurrence Matrix Factorization**: SVD decomposes word-context matrices (e.g., word-word co-occurrence counts) to produce dense vector representations.

**Example**: Early methods like GloVe (Global Vectors) use matrix factorization, though modern approaches (e.g., Word2Vec) often employ neural networks.

### Information Retrieval

Project queries and documents into a shared latent space for relevance matching, improving search results even with vocabulary mismatch.

### Topic Modeling

Identifies latent topics by interpreting singular vectors as topics. Each document is a combination of these topics, offering a simpler alternative to probabilistic models like LDA.

## Practical Considerations

### Dimensionality Reduction

- Choose \( k \) (number of retained singular values) via explained variance or cross-validation.
- Balances computational efficiency and information retention.

### Preprocessing

- Use TF-IDF instead of raw counts to emphasize discriminative terms.

### Scalability

- Randomized SVD or incremental methods handle large matrices efficiently.

## Limitations

- **Linearity Assumption**: Struggles with non-linear semantic relationships.
- **Orthogonality Constraint**: Topics are forced to be orthogonal, which may not reflect real-world overlaps.
- **Context Ignorance**: Fails to capture word order or context, unlike transformers or RNNs.

## Comparison to Modern Methods

**Strengths**: Computationally efficient, mathematically interpretable.

**Weaknesses**: Outperformed by neural models (e.g., BERT) in contextual tasks but remains useful for baseline analysis or resource-constrained settings.

## Example Workflow

1. Construct a TF-IDF term-document matrix \( X \).
2. Apply SVD: \( X \approx U_k \Sigma_k V_k^T \).
3. Represent documents as \( \Sigma_k V_k^T \) (low-dimensional vectors).
4. Use these vectors for tasks like clustering or retrieval.

## Conclusion

SVD is a versatile tool in NLP for uncovering latent semantics, reducing dimensionality, and improving computational efficiency. While newer deep learning methods have surpassed it in some areas, SVD remains relevant for its simplicity and effectiveness in foundational tasks.
