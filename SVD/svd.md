# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

is a fundamental matrix factorization technique used in linear algebra, data compression, and machine learning. It decomposes a matrix A into three matrices:

A=UΣV^T

Where:
𝑈 is an orthogonal matrix (left singular vectors)
Σ is a diagonal matrix (singular values)
𝑉^𝑇 is the transpose of an orthogonal matrix (right singular vectors)
